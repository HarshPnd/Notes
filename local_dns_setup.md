# Detailed Notes on Local DNS Setup and Related Commands

In this session, we explored multiple methods for setting up local DNS resolution and worked with Vagrant networking configurations, touching on key concepts like **`/etc/hosts`** file modification, networking in VMs, and DNS resolution. Below is a detailed breakdown of the concepts and commands used:

---

## 1. **Using the **`/etc/hosts`** File for Local DNS Resolution (Windows Version)**

The **`/etc/hosts`** file (on Linux and macOS) or **`hosts`** file (on Windows) is a local configuration file used for hostname-to-IP address mapping without relying on external DNS servers. This is useful for quickly resolving domain names in testing or local environments.

#### **Steps for Editing the Hosts File in Windows:**

1. **Opening Notepad as Administrator**:
   - **Why?** Editing the **`hosts`** file requires administrator privileges as it is a system file.
   - **Command:**
     - Search for **Notepad** in the Start menu.
     - Right-click and select **Run as administrator**.

2. **Navigating to the Hosts File**:
   - **Path:**
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
     ```
   - The **`hosts`** file is located in this directory. You need to select **All Files** in the file type dropdown to see it.

3. **Editing the Hosts File**:
   - **Syntax**:
     ```
     <IP Address>    <Hostname>
     ```
   - **Example**:
     ```
     192.168.1.10    mydomain.local
     ```
   - This entry tells your machine to resolve **`mydomain.local`** to **`192.168.1.10`**. This is useful for local testing when you want to access local servers using human-friendly domain names.

4. **Saving the File**:
   - After making the changes, save the file as a regular text file. Ensure the extension remains **`.hosts`**.

5. **Flushing DNS Cache**:
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     ipconfig /flushdns
     ```
   - This command clears the local DNS cache, ensuring that changes made in the **`hosts`** file take effect immediately.

6. **Testing DNS Resolution**:
   - **Ping or NSLookup**:
     ```bash
     ping mydomain.local
     ```
   - You can use this command to check if the machine resolves the domain to the correct IP address.

### 2. **DNS Setup Using Vagrant**

In Vagrant, networking can be configured to simulate environments similar to production with public and private networks, DNS setups, and port forwarding.

#### **Key Vagrant Concepts & Commands**:

1. **Setting Up Networking in Vagrant**:
   - Vagrant allows you to configure different types of networks:
     - **Public Network**: VMs receive IP addresses from the same range as your local machine.
     - **Private Network**: VMs can communicate with each other but are isolated from the external network.

   - **Vagrant Configuration**:
     ```ruby
     Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
       config.vm.box = "centos/7"
       config.vm.network "public_network"
       config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, auto_correct: true
     end
     ```

   - **Public Network**:
     - In this case, Vagrant automatically assigns an IP address from your local network’s DHCP.
     - Alternatively, you can assign a static IP using:
       ```ruby
       config.vm.network "public_network", ip: "192.168.29.102"
       ```

   - **Forwarded Port**:
     - Forwarding port **`80`** from the guest to port **`8080`** on the host allows you to access the Apache server running inside the VM using **`localhost:8080`**.

2. **Managing Multiple VMs in Vagrant**:
   - You can run multiple VMs using a single Vagrantfile:
     ```ruby
     Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
       (1..3).each do |i|
         config.vm.define "vm#{i}" do |vm_config|
           vm_config.vm.box = "centos/7"
           vm_config.vm.network "public_network"
           vm_config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080 + i, auto_correct: true
         end
       end
     end
     ```
   - Here, three VMs are created with identical configurations. The **`define`** block allows you to customize each VM (e.g., different IP addresses or forwarded ports).

### 3. **DNS Concepts:**

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts human-readable domain names (like **`example.com`**) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. A local DNS setup allows you to resolve custom domain names (e.g., **`mydomain.local`**) to specific IP addresses.

- **Using DNS Locally**:
   - Instead of setting up a full-fledged DNS server, you can modify the **`hosts`** file on your local machine to manually map hostnames to IP addresses. This is suitable for local development or small-scale testing environments.
   - Example:
     ```
     127.0.0.1    localhost
     192.168.1.10 mydomain.local
     ```

---

### 4. **Common Networking Commands Used**:

1. **IP Configuration**:
   - **Command**: **`ip a`**
   - Shows details of network interfaces and their configurations (IP addresses, MAC addresses, status, etc.).
   
   - **Example Output**:
     ```
     inet 192.168.29.102/24 brd 192.168.29.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic eth0
     ```

2. **Pinging a Host**:
   - **Command**: **`ping <hostname_or_ip>`**
   - Used to test network connectivity and DNS resolution. If you can’t **`ping`** a VM’s IP address, it’s usually a sign that the VM’s networking configuration or firewall settings need to be reviewed.

---

### 5. **Firewalls and SELinux in CentOS**:

1. **Disabling the Firewall**:
   - Sometimes firewall settings might block external connections to the VM. You can disable **`firewalld`** to test connectivity:
     ```bash
     systemctl stop firewalld
     systemctl disable firewalld
     ```

2. **Disabling SELinux**:
   - SELinux may prevent services from being accessed externally. You can disable it by editing the **`/etc/selinux/config`** file:
     ```bash
     setenforce 0
     ```
   - This command sets SELinux to permissive mode.
